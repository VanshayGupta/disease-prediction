# Insurance Premium Prediction
This project identifies gaps in the medical insurance application procedure by automating this procedure, thereby optimising it using machine learning and data analytics. The essence of this project lies in predicting the likelihood of a customer claiming insurance, which is directly related to the probability of them contracting diseases or exacerbating pre-existing comorbidities. Here, the user applies for insurance through a web portal, shortly after which the eligibility status and final cost for the applicant will be displayed. Under the hood, the applicantâ€™s medical history and blood reports are used to assess the probability of contracting Diabetes, cardiovascular or hepatic diseases. These are used to determine the risk level, based on which the eligibility status and final premium for the applicant will be displayed. With processing time and proneness to error less than the manual procedure, this study presents a marked solution to this real-life problem in the health insurance industry.

The research paper based on this project, [Data-driven Preprocessing Techniques for Early Diagnosis of Diabetes, Heart and Liver Diseases](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9616835), has been published in IEEE Xplore
